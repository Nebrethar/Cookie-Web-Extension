 # THIS IS NOT A FINISHED PROJECT
 
 Right now the functionality this project includes is to:
 
  - Provide logs of all cookie names values when  "LOG COOKIES" is pressed.<br />
  - Provide a button that says "CHANGE COOKIES" that modifies cookies temporarily.
  
 ### Next steps for the project:
 
  - Provide more specific methods of cookie modification and user control<br />
  - Create a new method of showing the user cookie values and information<br />
  - Continue to migrate away from API style of code
