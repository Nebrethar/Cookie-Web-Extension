# Cookie Web Extension
 
 This public repository is used to publish a FireFox web extension that is used to delete cookies with the "cookies" JavaScript API.
 
 It will eventually be used to delete cookies without the use of an API.
 
 ## API information

 # THIS IS NOT A FINISHED PROJECT
 
 Right now the functionality this project includes is to:
 
  - Provide logs of all cookie names values when  "LOG COOKIES" is pressed.<br />
  - Provide a button that says "CLEAR COOKIES".
  
 ### Next steps for the project:
 
  - Provide a way to clear all cookies with the "CLEAR COOKIES" button (almost finished)<br />
  - Provide more specific methods of clearing cookies<br />
  - Create a way to shows the user cookie values and information instead of logging values<br />
  - Move project away from API once the API version is satisfactory
